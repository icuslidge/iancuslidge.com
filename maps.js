      'cp_process is a five control point push map. A team wins by capturing all five control '
        + 'points at once, which must be done linearly by capturing the neutral middle and then '
        + 'taking the enemy team\'s points. It features a bright sunny art style, drawing off '
        + 'cp_gorge and the alpine environment set.'

    , 'Process was conceived of as a response to another 5cp map. Cp_follower was designed as a '
        + 'mixture of two maps, badlands and granary. It had the middle point of badlands and the '
        + 'second and last points of granary, the basic idea being that if you mix the two maps '
        + 'together you\'ll end up with something equal or better than the primary source. '
        + 'However, as the competitive player Sigma was quick to point out, Follower featured the '
        + 'weakest combination of points from those two maps. As an alternative, he felt that '
        + 'combining the middle from granary, the second point from badlands and the last point '
        + 'from well would create a much more interesting and dynamic flow.'

    , 'Building process, I decided early on against completely mimicking the layout of any of the '
        + 'three points, instead aiming to create something with the "spirit" of all three, but '
        + 'with its own unique flavor. The middle has some of the cargo container combat from '
        + 'Granary\'s middle, but plays out quite differently with numerous areas to push and '
        + 'hold. Second has a much shorter spire than Badlands, but also features numerous ways to '
        + 'rotate around the spire and engage the enemy team. Last is the most different, a very '
        + 'minimal version of Well, but also offers numerous affective ways in to engage the enemy '
        + 'team.'

    , 'Process has been quite well received by many competitive players, and is highly likely to '
        + 'be a staple for seasons to come. It has been played in ESEA, starting in Season 11, '
        + 'OZfortress League, and in numerous Highlander pick up games, as well as in UGC season '
        + '9. It also won second place in the Asymmetry/Symmetry contest from TF2maps.net.'

      'cp_standin is a three control point "domination" map. A team wins a round by capturing all '
        + 'three points at once, while preventing the enemy team from capturing points they have '
        + 'already secured. All three points start neutral and are equidistant from both teams\' '
        + 'spawns, with multiple exits allowing players to approach them from either side. The map '
        + 'is quite hectic, and involves a great deal of tactical engagement and strategy in order '
        + 'to properly coordinate players across the map.'

    , 'The map was originally conceived following a forum post regarding what competitive players '
        + 'wanted in a map. The pocket soldier TLR made a comment about the map cp_fallout '
        + '(THE PUNS!), to the affect that though the map was inherently asymmetrical and featured '
        + 'a variety of problems that made it unsuitable for competitive play, the game mode '
        + 'itself was quite interesting and if it could be adjusted, might make for a very fast '
        + 'paced competitive map.'

    , 'Standin addresses one of the primary problems of traditional 5cp maps. Though the layout of '
        + 'these maps is quite strong and works well within the framework of competitive play, the '
        + 'location of the choke points and the ability for teams to hold on either side of them '
        + 'often leads to teams stalemating at certain points, waiting for the other team to make '
        + 'a move. Because the chokes are built to block line of sight, players who try to '
        + 'approach a choke are punished, while players that hold back are kept safe. Further, '
        + 'because the only points which are active are generally located behind both teams, the '
        + 'objective of the map is locked out by the chokes as well. This is good in that it '
        + 'forces players to contend with the other team in order to progress, but bad in the '
        + 'sense that it can be difficult to break the stalemate and accomplish the map\'s '
        + 'objective in this scenario.'

    , 'With Standin\'s layout, holding a choke is still a successful strategy. However, one of the '
        + 'key features of the map is that a team always has some additional options available '
        + 'when it comes to objectives. A team holding B and A is likely to be defending B and '
        + 'waiting to push C to win the round. The enemy team can use this to their advantage, '
        + 'sneaking a scout behind the enemy team and starting to capture A. Teams can also start '
        + 'the match by splitting and capturing both A and C, leaving B for last, or push into A, '
        + 'and then to B. The amount of options available is significant and leads to players '
        + 'making many decisions on the fly about when to push a point, when to retreat, when to '
        + 'block a capture, or when to stack a point and hope to outrace the enemy team.'

    , 'Standin is certainly an anomaly among competitive maps. It allows a whole host of available '
        + 'options, plays very aggressively and often comes down to the wire. It can be quite '
        + 'stressful for a player in a competitive scenario, as it has very few precedents to draw '
        + 'upon, and some of the oddities of neutral control points and long cap times can lead to '
        + 'some very "innovative" ways to abuse capture times.'

    , 'In terms of its general reception, I think its fair to say that Standin is one of the most '
        + 'controversial maps in competitive TF2. Some of the best North American players value it '
        + 'for its blistering gameplay, incredible reliance upon tactics, and  its need for '
        + 'coordination and teamwork. Other players see it as an abomination, bending the gameplay '
        + 'of a 5cp map on its back and adding unnecessary complexity to a perfect formula.'

    , 'Standin was played in ESEA Season 10, UGC Highlander Summer Season 7, and the OZfortress '
        + 'League. It is unlikely to be played again in ESEA, but UGC admins seem fairly receptive '
        + 'to it, and it may see some additional play in Highlander (it was scheduled to be played '
        + 'in UGC season 9, but was replaced at the last minute).'

        + 'started focusing more on comp tf2. It was played quite frequently by the My Gaming Edge '

        + 'of room to move around and allows teams reapproach if they survive for long enough. The '

        + 'condensed. In a koth map, you need enough distance between the point and the spawns to '

        + 'the inherent problems with CTF, namely the ability to turtle endlessly, and the '
        + 'overemphasis on the flag locations.'

    , 'Vitalism started with the idea (derived from ctf_atrophy) of moving the capture locations '
        + 'away from the flag rooms, thus forcing players to commit to the center of the map if '
        + 'they wanted to sucessfully win a round, instead of just turtling in their base. '

        + 'pace, I\'ve reduced the return rate of the flag to 5 seconds, to ensure that a flag '
        + 'can\'t just be zerged into the capture point, as well as locking capture points if the '
