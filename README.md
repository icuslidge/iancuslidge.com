This is a portfolio website that was created using express 3 and angular 1.2.

In Oct 2017 I decided I didn't want to host the nodejs server anymore so I made
some modifications to allow me to use
[express-snapshot](https://github.com/alexmingoia/express-snapshot) to generate
a static HTML version of the site for Github Pages.

See `snapshot.js` and `gh-pages.sh`.
