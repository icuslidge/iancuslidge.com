About halfway through the contest, I got somewhat frustrated with my visual style and bowed out. The map was designed to solve some of the inherent problems with CTF, namely the ability to turtle endlessly, and the overemphasis on the flag locations.</p><br/><p>Vitalism started with the idea (derived from ctf_atrophy) of moving the capture locations away from the flag rooms, thus forcing players to commit to the center of the map if they wanted to sucessfully win a round, instead of just turtling in their base. Additionally, I adjusted the layout to allow attackers to push into the flag  room with significant height advantage, so that defending the flag required a more offensive approach, holding the upper area in the middle of the map before pushing into the enemy team and capturing their flag. Finally, because of the size of the map and the quick pace, I've reduced the return rate of the flag to 5 seconds, to ensure that a flag can't just be zerged into the capture point, as well as locking capture points if the flag is being carried, ensuring that players must fight the flag carrier if they want to capture the enemy's flag. The map was designed for frequent captures, as most non-pub server rulesets allow for up to ten captures to win a match.</p><br/><p>During the summer of 2012, UGC admins approached me about having the map featured in their summer season with a host of other more experimental maps. I wanted to make some changes to the map, to address certain balance issues. Unfortunately, vitalism's original beta hammer files seemed to have some sort of bug, such that compiling any version of the map resulted in all the brush textures turning completely black. After the season was over, I decided to go back to the basic alpha versions of the map and work from the ground up to implement a new version of the map with a much improved visual style.</p><br/><p>Haunt is the result of this. It uses the mann manor textures and props to create a very evocative internal environment. The map is still a work in progress, as the visual style requires some significant rethinking to lighting and visibility. Several players have complained about darkness in the map, so I'll be going back and looking at some of the interior spaces with an eye towards visual clarity. Likewise, the outside areas need some pretty signficant adjustments in terms of optimization. The mann manor style is very heavy on props, and vitalism was not really very well thought out in terms of dividing up the map for rendering. I'm also interested in adjusting the respawn times, in order to help alleviate turtling.</p><br/><p>Vitalism was played in season 7 of UGC highlander, and haunt was played in season 9.</p></div><div class="span8 scorpio-spacer"></div></div><div class="span9 offset1 scorpio-spacer"></div></div></div><script>$('img.img-polaroid').colorbox({rel:'gal', fixed:'true'});</script>
