First, it gave me a chance to create a level based around a mashup of Mirror's Edge's clean cityscape and koth_king's dirtier urban take on TF2. And second, it allowed me to fix some of the layout flaws of cp_standin that became apparent after I finished developing it. It also gave me an opportunity to work a bit more in the realm of the 45 degree angle, forcing myself to think a bit more about how geometry comes together.</p><br/><p>The original idea for rooftop was a CTF map, where teams would push out across a series of rooftop structures to try and invade the opposing base and return, while also avoiding a hazardous trip to the ground below. However, given the relative lack of good CTF maps to draw from, I scrapped that idea, and instead returned to an earlier idea concerning the layout for cp_standin. For that version, the B point would be in an internal space, and then the A and C points would be located outside. This would help differentiate the three points, making sure players knew exactly where they needed to go in order to prevent the enemy team from winning, and also ensured that the three points were separate but still accessible.</p><br/><p>Rooftop has been an interesting map to develop. The playable space of the map came together quite quickly, and has had very few changes to the layout. Its balanced, and it works quite well in terms of players being able to transition between the various areas. The exterior area of the map, however, has present something of a problem. Though koth_king has been quite influential in terms of the basic idea of what the exterior should look like, it actually doesn't work very well to try and implement a koth_king skyline in cp_rooftop. A lot of that has to do with the size of rooftop, as well as the vantage point. Koth_king takes place at ground level, while rooftop is much higher. The art assets for koth_king are meant to be seen from below, and relatively up close, and the optimization of the map functions best when things around a corner aren't visible.</p><br/><p>Rooftop, on the other hand, is quite a bit further from the buildings and structures, meaning that smaller details aren't easily visible. Additionally, much more of the map is visible at once, so the more intricate the detailing the worse the performance. On top of that, the way that koth_king generates brushes runs up against the source engines brush limit, a problem that has been replicated in initial versions of cp_rooftop. I've been examining Mirror's Edge again to get a better idea on what sort of assets would be needed to create cleaner structures, and better optimization as far as detailing. Quite a lot of the buildings in Mirror's Edge are composed of a few brushes with complementary textures to give the impression of windows, rather than a maze of props or individual brushes.</p><br/><p>Rooftop is still a work in progress, as I tinker with the visual style of the surroundings. The gameplay is where I want it to be, but some visual elements are sure to be reworked.</p></div><div class="span8 scorpio-spacer"></div></div><div class="span9 offset1 scorpio-spacer"></div></div></div><script>$('img.img-polaroid').colorbox({rel:'gal', fixed:'true'});</script>
