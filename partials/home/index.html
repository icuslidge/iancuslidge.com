for Team Fortress 2, for their June 2013 update. Both maps are now
official and are directly available anytime someone downloads TF2.
Some words of praise from the update:</p><br/><p class="scorpio-quote">"Beyond a great polish, both of these maps offer unique and exciting
gameplay; Process with its five streamlined Capture Points and
Standin with its triple Cap Point free-for-all."</p><p class="scorpio-quote">"These maps were selected by the TF2 team in part for their
straightforward and intuitive layouts, and in part because they were
a hell of a lot of fun to play. These CP maps were designed with
little visual noise, were easy to understand and fun to navigate
through. If you're a community map maker and want to see us ship
your map, here's another spoiler on how to do that: Make it better
than these."</p><p>A link to the blog post (<a href="http://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=11023">http://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=11023</a>).</p><br/><h4>SKILLS</h4><strong>Hammer Level Editor</strong><p>I’ve spent the past four years using Valve’s hammer editor to design
levels for Team Fortress 2.
I’m currently proficient with generating rough but playable alphas,
moving a team fortress map from undetailed alpha to detailed beta,
and finalizing the map through playtest and iteration. This includes
knowledge of how to generate custom objectives, and wire together the
basic workings of a map via the hammer entity  system. Though
generally focused on multiplayer first person games, I could easily
learn how to develop for any genre and single player game type if
given the opportunity.</p><br/><strong>Excellent Writing Skills</strong><p>My Bachelors and Masters both emphasized writing ability. Philosophy
requires the ability to weigh arguments and understand complex word
play (ask me about Deleuze’s conception of schizophrenia!), but also
the ability to engage with those arguments and see the problems or
strengths of a given line of reasoning. Further, much of philosophy
is boiling down or simplifying a rather larger concept, ensuring
that it can be dealt with in a reasonable timeframe. This could
prove useful for getting a rather large game design idea into a
concise description.</p><br/><strong>Game Analysis</strong><p>Another element of my philosophical training is to analyze things
from a variety of positions and weigh the strengths and weaknesses
of a theory. This has proven quite useful in evaluating games as well,
as game design decisions are often implicit and must be teased out.
Further, I’m quite well versed in game design decisions both
traditionally (chess, go, ancient games), modern (first person
shooters especially, but I’m well versed in most MMO, RPG, RTS
decisions), and the general shape of modern gaming.</p><br/><h4>EDUCATION</h4><strong>Master's Degree, Modern European Philosophy</strong><p>09/2008 – Graduating in 09/2009</p><p>Middlesex University | London, England</p><br/><p>I traveled to the UK to study Modern European Philosophy. My study
was focused on Hegel, Kant, Deleuze, Negri, Sartre and Badiou, as
well as engaging with modern takes on their perspectives. My
dissertation was written on the philosophy of Deleuze, classical
games, and modern game design.
